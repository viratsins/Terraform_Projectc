# AWS-FaultTolerant-Infra
This Terraform-based architecture deploys a multi-region, high-availability AWS setup with VPCs in `us-east-1` and `us-west-1`, featuring ALBs in public subnets and EC2 instances in private subnets. ALBs route traffic securely, while modular components ensure scalability, redundancy, and fault tolerance for minimal downtime.
